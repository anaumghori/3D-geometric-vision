# 3D Geometric Vision

This repository is a collection of implementations, experiments, and algorithms mainly focused on 3D and geometric computer vision as well as robotics-related problems that rely on geometric reasoning, with occasional explorations of other fundamental computer vision techniques. Each project includes its own README file with setup instructions.  

## Available Implementations

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Camera Calibration](https://github.com/anaumghori/3D-geometric-vision/tree/main/CameraCalibration) | Implementation of complete camera calibration, including intrinsic parameters, extrinsic poses, and distortion coefficients. |
| [Panorama Stitching](https://github.com/anaumghori/3D-geometric-vision/tree/main/PanoramaStitching) | Multi-image panorama creation using ORB feature detection, homography estimation with RANSAC, and iterative pairwise stitching with distance transform-based blending. |
| [Voxels-3D-CNN](https://github.com/anaumghori/3D-geometric-vision/tree/main/Voxels-3D-CNN) | 3D point cloud classification using sparse voxel convolutional neural networks trained on ShapeNet dataset, with interactive Plotly visualizations for exploring predictions. |
