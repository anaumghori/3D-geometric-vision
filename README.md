# 3D Geometric Vision

This repository is a collection of implementations, experiments, and algorithms mainly focused on 3D and geometric computer vision as well as robotics-related problems that rely on geometric reasoning, with occasional explorations of other fundamental computer vision techniques. Each project includes its own README file with setup instructions.
